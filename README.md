# VlasovPoisson
The following repository contains my last undergraduate project, which aims to simulate the Vlasov Poisson system of equations using the symplectic Stormer-Verlet technique. Particularly, modeling the Vlasov Poisson system can lead to the development of innovative, symplectic numerical and model reduction techniques.
